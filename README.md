### Launch.
1. This repository was developed using python 3.8.
2. The repository provides a requirements.txt file with all the necessary dependencies. 
They can be installed with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

To process one of the pdf with a fixed format it is necessary to introduce it in `data/pdf/` 
and write its name in the Extractor class. The class Extractor will take the pdf,
convert it into txt and extract all the entities. 

#### REMARKS
This repository only works for a concrete type of document
One of the regexes use that some of the amounts are preceded by "â‚¬".
